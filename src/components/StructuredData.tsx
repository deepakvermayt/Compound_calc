Unlike simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount, compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time as you earn interest on your interest. This powerful financial concept is often called 'the eighth wonder of the world' because of its ability to significantly increase wealth over long periods."

For example, if you invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest compounded monthly for 10 years, your calculation would be: A = 1000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12Ã—10) = $1,643.62."

Compound interest, however, is calculated on the principal plus any previously earned interest, causing the interest to 'compound' or grow over time. For example, with $1,000 at 5% for 10 years: simple interest would earn $500 total, while compound interest (monthly compounding) would earn $643.62 - that's $143.62 more!"
